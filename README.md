# nvim config

This is my personal nvim config, used to work with Typescript and Python. Feel free to use as an inspiration!

I personally used the following repositories (and probably others) as inspiration myself:

* https://github.com/harrisoncramer/nvim/
* https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/tree/master/nvim/.config/nvim/
